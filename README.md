wouldn't it be nice if we could use this as a polyfill 
for normal programs, so we can have applications linking to each others

file players n general

file explorers, with internet, but tabbed, with windows being framed
like a browser with tab
but it plays executeables

beautiful

peple seem to be needing the browser internet experience
i feel lonely without it too
so i like to have it on and open

at the same time i use 'native' apps like vs code

isn't a tab holder just another task bar?

but everthing ys on the web
